# my vimrc
Ù‘I'm [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) user like many people and I'm sharing my vimrc here. It's not something special or complicated(I am not a fan of complexity), but it might be useful to someone.

### Install dependencies
I am ArchLinux user and I usually write code in Python language.

```
sudo pacman -S vim python-lsp-server python-pycodestyle vim-jedi

Install `python-pyflakes` if you want pep8, ...

### Install VimPlug
I use [VimPlug]([url](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)). Install it with this command.

### Run VimPlug
Run this vim command. You know how to do it, don't you? Press `ESC` key. Press `:` key. Write this command in vim and press `Enter`.

Once the plugins are installed, exit by typing the following command.

It's my pycodstyle file config. Use it if it helps you.
